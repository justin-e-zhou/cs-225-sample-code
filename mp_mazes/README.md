# mp_mazes
Implemented a disjoint set in order to create a randomized maze. The maze is then solved using a BFS algorithm.

## Files I Wrote
- dsets.cpp/h
- maze.cpp/h

## To Run the Code
1. Run the makefile using ```make```
2. Run ```./mazes```
3. It will create a 50x50 maze named ```regular.png``` and a solved version of the same maze named ```regularSolved.png```
