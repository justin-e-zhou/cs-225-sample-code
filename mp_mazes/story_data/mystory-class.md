You see that Bill Gates is visiting your CS 225 class today! You hurriedly finish your cereal and get ready to head to class. You look outside and its snowing! It doesn't matter, since your only outfit is shorts and a t-shirt. You step outside, seemingly impervious to the 5 degree weather. You hop on the bus and arrive to class. You see everyone else bundled up in their Canada Goose jackets and you scoff at them. You then take a seat and pull out your 2019 MacBook Pro and iPad Pro 12.9 inch along with your Apple Pencil.

The class starts and Professor Evans starts talking about trees. "Why are we learning about the environment in a computer science class?" you think to yourself. "I came here to learn how to get a high-paying job!"

As you are about to doze off to Professor Evans' soothing voice, you hear him say, "Lets welcome our guest speaker for today, Bill Gates!" Your eyes shoot open and you catch a glimpse of the charming smile of the wealthiest man on Earth.

As you listen to Bill Gates speak, he says how he will give an internship at Microsoft to the person whose resume impresses him the most. This is your chance! Now you can finally impress everyone with a shiny internship at Microsoft!
