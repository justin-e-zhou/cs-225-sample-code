On your MacBook Pro 2019, you quickly go to the web print site and upload the document on your hard drive titled "resume 11-2013.png". You hope it is the right file as you pay the sky-high price of $0.05 per page. The site shows it has printed, so you dash out of the lecture hall, looking for where in the world it is. 

You run out of the lecture hall, trying to find ECEB 1005. Running around for another couple of minutes, you find the room and sprint to the printer. You see your freshly printed resume sitting there in all it's glory. There is no time to admire it, you grab it and run back to the lecture hall where you see a large pile of resumes in front of Bill Gates. Gasping for breath, you trudge your way through the sea of students and hand your resume to Bill.

"Here you go, Mr. Gates, I hope you like it," you try to say through your pants of exhaustion. He looks at you and smiles. "Thank you," he replies. You sit back down at your seat and Professor Evans begins wrapping up today's class.
