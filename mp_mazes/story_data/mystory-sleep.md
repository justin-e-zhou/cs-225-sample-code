You fall back into a restless and fitful sleep. You awaken hours later. The room is dark. The sun has gone down. You hear the voice of Professor Evans. "Don't forget to do your MP." Startled, you fratically look around, but you see nothing. You close your eyes and pinch yourself to make sure you aren't dreaming. You feel nothing.

You Lose.
