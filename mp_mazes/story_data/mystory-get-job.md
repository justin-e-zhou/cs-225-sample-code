You head home for the day and you lie down in bed. You are exhausted from all that running you had to do. You close your eyes and you drift off into sleep.

You are startled awake by your phone buzzing. It's a phone call... from the state of Washington? Who could this be? You pick up the phone. 

"Hello?" You say in a groggy voice. 

"Hi," replies the voice on the other end of the phone. You instantly recognize that voice! You had just heard it only a couple hours prior! It is Bill Gates! 

Bill keeps talking, "I am just calling to let you know that I have chosen you as the one who gets the internship at Microsoft. Congratulations!"

You are beyond words at this point. You stammer out a, "thank you," and exchange a few words before hanging up.

You jump up in joy! This was your big break! You got the internship at Microsoft!

You win!
